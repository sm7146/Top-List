MAKING A WEBPAGE<br><br>
<b>Major Pieces</b><br>
User-Computer/browser-Internet-Server connected by HTTP <br>
<br>
<b>HTML</b> - Hyper Text Markup Language<br>
<p>- Text Content : what you see</p> 
<p>- Markup : how the page looks
<p>- Reference : allows for the presnetation of images and videos</p>
<p>- Links</p><br>
<b>Webpage</b> - Text documents written in HTML language.  They are intepretted by browsers and displayed.<br><br>
*Computers are stupid, meaning they must be told what to do using <em>SYNTAX</em>.<br>
<br>
<b>Basic HTML Vocabulary</b><br><br>
- Tags : Contained within angled brackets < > .  Use opening and closing tags < / > that tell what action<br> is rquired by the tag and where to end the action.    Some tags are considered <em>VOID</em> tags and do not <br> require a closing tag.  Tags can be <em>inline</em> ( < b >, < em >, < span >) or <em>block ( < p >, < div > ). </em><br><br>

-  Element : Refers to everyting with the opeing and closing tag.<br><br>- Attribute : Property of the HTML element.  Ex.  href is an attribute of the anchor tag < a  href="www.udacity.com"><br><br>
CREATING A STRUCTURED DOCUMENT WITH HTML<br><br>
<b>Key Concepts</b><br><br>
- HTML and CSS are both languages<br><br>
- HTML controls the structure of the web<br><br>
- CSS controls the style of a page or <em>how it looks</em><br><br>
- DOM is the tree like structure of the webpage<br><br>
<b>HTML</b> - Language has Syntax + Rules<br><br>
<b>CSS</b> - also uses syntax and rules<br><br>
<b>DOM</b> - Document Object Model is the element tree<br><br>
<b>Boxes</b> - Webpages are built using boxes.  When you see circles, triangles, or any other shape they are actually boxes<br> which CSS defines the shape using the developer tools<br><br>
